/**
 * ATLAS_CASES_AT_INVENTORY — the eval set for the atlas `at-inventory` agent bucket
 * (Inventory & Catalog: listAssets, getAsset, registerAsset, updateAssetCondition,
 * scheduleMaintenance, completeMaintenance, getMaintenanceLog, retireAsset, transferAsset).
 *
 * Authored under Stage G3 of the agentspec-generator skill (BARRED-style: dimension
 * decomposition → boundary-biased sampling → asymmetric-debate validation → refine/
 * discard). Cases are derived ONLY from WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + presets.ts +
 * world.ts exec semantics + judge-prompt.md — NEVER from any drafted AgentSpec (a
 * spec-derived eval would test the spec against itself). See EVALS-at-inventory.md for
 * the full dimension→case map, per-case debate verdicts, and discards.
 *
 * TYPE NOTE: these are ScenarioSpec-shaped, but this self-contained subject uses its own
 * `brandPreset` names (the presets in presets.ts) and a single `conversationMode: 'ALL'`,
 * neither of which is a member of the Criaty `BrandPreset` / `AGENT_MODES` enums the
 * imported ScenarioSpec type pins. The self-contained pack maps these strings at load
 * time (as beauty/cases.ts does) — hence the `as unknown as ScenarioSpec[]` cast.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: every date literal is stated relative to the fixed reference clock
 * REFERENCE_DATE = 2026-07-01 (a constant, never the wall clock); every id / rate /
 * deposit is a fixed function of the preset seed — no RNG. Seeded fleet facts used here
 * (from the `default` / `onboarded` preset unless noted):
 *   ast_excv01  CAT 320 Excavator      excellent  available  850/day  dep 3000  (idle; empty maint log)
 *   ast_excv02  Kubota KX040 Mini Exc. good       RESERVED   420/day  dep 1500  (bk_1001 confirmed 07-10→07-15)
 *   ast_load01  John Deere 544 Loader  good       available  700/day  dep 2500  (bk_1002 returned → idle)
 *   ast_boom01  Genie S-65 Boom Lift   good       OUT        380/day  dep 1200  (checked out on rental)
 *   ast_gen01   Cat XQ125 Generator    good       available  220/day  dep 800   (bk_1003 closed → idle)
 *   ast_gen02   Honda EU7000 Generator fair       MAINTENANCE 90/day  dep 300   (carburetor service 06-28→07-05, NOT completed)
 *   ast_pump01  Godwin CD100 Trash Pump good      available  140/day  dep 500   (idle)
 *   ast_trlr01  PJ 20ft Equipment Trlr good       available  110/day  dep 400   (idle)
 * Fleet writes (register/updateCondition/schedule/complete/retire/transfer) require the
 * acting user to have canManageFleet (owner/admin). In `limited-permission` the acting
 * user is a dispatcher (canManageFleet=false). retire/transfer are two-step confirm AND
 * blocked while the asset is out / reserved by an active booking / under a hold.
