/**
 * ATLAS_CASES_AT_RENTALS — the eval set for the `at-rentals` agent bucket of the
 * "atlas" subject (Atlas Equipment Rentals & Field Ops).
 *
 * Bucket tools (13, AGENT-MAP): checkAvailability, listBookings, getBooking,
 * createBooking, rescheduleBooking, cancelBooking, checkOutAsset, checkInAsset,
 * closeBooking, listTechnicians, getTechnicianSchedule, dispatchTechnician,
 * cancelDispatch. Destructive (two-step confirm): cancelBooking, cancelDispatch.
 * The bucket owns NO money/deposit/quota tools — deposit release, quota reads, and
 * holds live in other agents; the correct behaviour on those is to defer (scope
 * boundary), not to guess.
 *
 * Authored under Stage G3 of the agentspec-generator skill (BARRED-style: dimension
 * decomposition → boundary-biased sampling → asymmetric-debate validation →
 * refine/discard). Cases are derived ONLY from WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json +
 * presets.ts + world.ts — never from any drafted AgentSpec (a spec-derived eval would
 * test the spec against itself). See EVALS-at-rentals.md for the dimension→case map,
 * per-case debate verdicts, and deferred sub-items.
 *
 * TYPE NOTE: these are ScenarioSpec-shaped, but this self-contained subject uses its
 * own atlas preset names and a single `conversationMode: 'ALL'`, neither of which is a
 * member of the Criaty `BrandPreset` / `AGENT_MODES` enums the imported ScenarioSpec
 * type pins. The self-contained pack maps these strings at load time (exactly as beauty
 * and config/examples/toy.ts do) — hence the `as unknown as ScenarioSpec[]` cast.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: REFERENCE_DATE = 2026-07-01 (a fixed literal, never the wall clock).
 * "Future" = a date strictly after 2026-07-01. Every id/date/rate below is a fixed
 * function of the preset seed — no RNG, no clock. Seeded ids used here:
 *   default preset — bk_1001 (ast_excv02, confirmed, dep 1500 held/1500 req),
 *     bk_1002 (ast_load01, returned), bk_1003 (ast_gen01, closed); available assets
 *     ast_pump01 (rate 140/dep 500), ast_excv01 (rate 850/dep 3000), etc.;
 *     customers cust_2001 (Redstone), cust_2002 (Vista), cust_2003 (Harbor Point);
 *     technicians tech_01 (Marcus Reyes), tech_02 (Dana Whitfield); owner acting.
 *   legal-hold-active — hold_9001 legal ASSET hold on ast_excv01 (blocks it);
 *     hold_9002 compliance ACCOUNT hold on cust_2003 (cust_2001 is NOT frozen).
 *   quota-exhausted — starter plan, atBookingCap (3/3 active: bk_1001, bk_1002
 *     confirmed; bk_1003 ast_gen01 OUT, dep 800/800); ast_pump01 still available.
 *   reschedule-conflict — bk_1001 & bk_1002 both on ast_load01, non-overlapping
 *     (07-10→07-14 and 07-20→07-24); the free gap is 07-15…07-19.
