/**
 * ATLAS_CASES_AT_ADMIN — the eval set for the atlas "Workspace Admin" agent bucket
 * (at-admin). Twelve boundary-biased scenarios (ids 81–92) exercising the eight standard
 * G3 axes for THIS bucket's tool surface:
 *   getWorkspace · getPlanUsage · listMembers · getMember · inviteMember ·
 *   updateMemberRole · removeMember · changePlan · getAuditLog
 * (destructive / two-step confirm: removeMember, changePlan).
 *
 * AUTHORING PROVENANCE (agentspec-generator, Stage G3 / BARRED): cases are derived ONLY from
 * WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + presets.ts + world.ts + judge-prompt.md — NEVER from any drafted
 * AgentSpec (a spec-derived eval would test the spec against itself). Each case was validated by
 * rigid-Advocate-vs-two-Judges debate (label faithfulness / satisfiability / unambiguity), refined
 * ≤2× or discarded. The dimension→case map and per-case verdicts live in EVALS-at-admin.md.
 *
 * TYPE NOTE: these are ScenarioSpec-shaped, but this self-contained subject uses its own
 * `brandPreset` names (the presets in presets.ts) and a single `conversationMode: 'ALL'`, neither
 * of which is a member of the Criaty BrandPreset / AGENT_MODES enums the imported ScenarioSpec type
 * pins. The self-contained pack maps these strings at load time (exactly as beauty/cases.ts and
 * config/examples/toy.ts do) — hence the `as unknown as ScenarioSpec[]` cast.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: REFERENCE_DATE = 2026-07-01 (a fixed literal, never the wall clock). Every id/role
 * below is a fixed function of the preset seed. Seeded admin state referenced here:
 *   default/onboarded : ws_atlas "Atlas Equipment Rentals", plan=pro (seatCap 5, bookingCap 10);
 *                       acting user = mem_0001 Sam Okafor (OWNER). Members: mem_0001 owner ·
 *                       mem_0002 Lena Park (dispatcher) · mem_0003 Raj Bhatt (billing) →
 *                       seatsUsed 3/5, activeBookingsUsed 1/10 (only bk_1001 confirmed; bk_1002
 *                       returned, bk_1003 closed). Customers: cust_2001 Redstone / cust_2002 Vista
 *                       / cust_2003 Harbor Point. Fresh workspace → empty audit log.
 *   quota-exhausted   : plan=starter (seatCap 2, bookingCap 3); acting = mem_0001 OWNER. Members:
 *                       mem_0001 owner · mem_0002 Lena Park (dispatcher) → seatsUsed 2/2 → atSeatCap,
 *                       and 3/3 active bookings → atBookingCap.
 *   limited-permission: acting user = mem_0002 Lena Park (DISPATCHER; canManageMembers=false,
 *                       canMoveMoney=false). Members: mem_0001 owner · mem_0002 dispatcher (acting)
 *                       · mem_0003 Raj Bhatt (billing). plan=pro.
 * Permission law (world.ts): inviteMember/updateMemberRole/removeMember require canManageMembers
 * (owner/admin); changePlan is OWNER-only; the sole owner cannot be removed/demoted; inviteMember is
 * rejected SEAT_QUOTA_REACHED at the seat cap; a downgrade below current usage is rejected.
