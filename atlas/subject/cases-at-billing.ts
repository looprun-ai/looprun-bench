/**
 * ATLAS_CASES_AT_BILLING — the eval set for the atlas "Billing & Payments" agent bucket
 * (at-billing). Twelve boundary-biased scenarios (ids 21–32) exercising the eight standard
 * G3 axes for THIS bucket's tool surface:
 *   generateQuote · getQuote · generateInvoice · listInvoices · getInvoice ·
 *   getDepositBalance · chargeDeposit · releaseDeposit · payInvoice · issueRefund · voidInvoice
 * (destructive / money-moving: chargeDeposit, releaseDeposit, payInvoice, issueRefund,
 * voidInvoice — two-step confirm).
 *
 * AUTHORING PROVENANCE (agentspec-generator, Stage G3 / BARRED): cases are derived ONLY from
 * WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + presets.ts + world.ts + judge-prompt.md — NEVER from any drafted
 * AgentSpec (a spec-derived eval would test the spec against itself). Each case was validated by
 * rigid-Advocate-vs-two-Judges debate (label faithfulness / satisfiability / unambiguity), refined
 * ≤2× or discarded. The dimension→case map and per-case verdicts live in EVALS-at-billing.md.
 *
 * TYPE NOTE: these are ScenarioSpec-shaped, but this self-contained subject uses its own
 * `brandPreset` names (the presets in presets.ts) and a single `conversationMode: 'ALL'`, neither
 * of which is a member of the Criaty BrandPreset / AGENT_MODES enums the imported ScenarioSpec type
 * pins. The self-contained pack maps these strings at load time (exactly as beauty/cases.ts and
 * config/examples/toy.ts do) — hence the `as unknown as ScenarioSpec[]` cast.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: REFERENCE_DATE = 2026-07-01 (a fixed literal, never the wall clock). Every id/amount
 * below is a fixed function of the preset seed; a generateInvoice in an invoice-free booking mints
 * inv_7001 (reads never advance the id sequence), billableDays = dayDiff(end,start) with a
 * same-day rental billing 1 day, and the quote/invoice math is deterministic. Seeded facts used:
 *   ── CATALOG (from listAssets/getAsset) ──
 *   ast_excv01 CAT 320 Excavator : dailyRate 850, requiredDeposit 3000, deliveryFee 400, insuranceFee 120
 *   ast_load01 John Deere 544 Loader: dailyRate 700, requiredDeposit 2500, deliveryFee 350, insuranceFee 100
 *   ast_gen01  Cat XQ125 Generator : dailyRate 220, requiredDeposit  800, deliveryFee 150, insuranceFee  40
 *   quote(ast_excv01, 2026-07-10→2026-07-13, +delivery +insurance) = 850×3 + 400 + 120 = 3070, deposit 3000.

 *     bk_1003 + inv_7003 (closed; inv_7003 PAID, total 1030, amountPaid 1030).
 *   ── pending-confirmation ── bk_1001 (ast_load01, cust_2001, RETURNED, deposit 2500) +
 *     inv_7001 (ISSUED, unpaid, total 3850, balanceDue 3850). No claim, no hold.
 *   ── open-claim ── bk_1001 (ast_load01, cust_2002, RETURNED, deposit 2500) + clm_3001
 *     (damage, UNDER_REVIEW) + hold_9001 (safety/asset/ast_load01). releaseDeposit BLOCKED.
 *   ── legal-hold-active ── bk_1001 (ast_excv01, cust_2003, RETURNED, deposit 3000, inv_7001 PAID
 *     amountPaid 4250) + hold_9001 (legal/asset/ast_excv01) + hold_9002 (compliance/account/cust_2003).
 *     issueRefund/releaseDeposit BLOCKED by the account/asset freeze.
 *   ── low-deposit-balance ── bk_1001 (ast_excv01, cust_2001, CONFIRMED, deposit 1000; required 3000
 *     → shortfall 2000). Upcoming booking, not returned.
 *   ── limited-permission ── acting user = dispatcher (canMoveMoney=false); inv_7001 (issued, 3500).
 * Two-step protocol (judge principle 5): confirmed=false → probe/prompt → STOP; confirmed=true only
 * after an explicit user go-ahead. Numeric fidelity (principles 4/8/11): every stated figure traces
 * to a tool result — never quoted from memory, never invented.
