/**
 * atlas — `at-claims` AgentSpec (Claims & Compliance bucket).
 *
 * BUCKET: damage/incident claims, legal & compliance holds, customer records, policy lookup
 * (12 tools; 2 destructive: resolveClaim, releaseHold).
 *
 * LAYER RATIONALE — one AgentSpecBase (P9). The constructor auto-installs the universal invariants
 * (noDuplicateCall + degenerationGuard + emptyReply) and, because `cfg.lexicon.falseFailureClaimRe`
 * is provided, the always-on reply-honesty invariant (noFalseFailureClaim); because `destructiveTools`
 * is non-empty it also installs the destructive-safety protocol (confirmFirst + destructiveThrottle)
 * on exactly resolveClaim/releaseHold. Everything below is AGENT-layer, authored explicitly, each a
 * prose+check pair keyed only on args / world projection / observed calls (never the user text — the
 * S-1 firewall). All language patterns are inlined here to keep the file self-contained (P8a: the
 * runtime carries no linguistic regex; a real bundle would share one atlas EN lexicon module).
 *
 * // UNCHECKABLE (eval dimension only — no observable discriminator on the guard surface):
 * //  - CLAIM-REF PROVENANCE beyond id SHAPE: that a filed claim references an id genuinely surfaced
 * //    from a read/create this conversation (not a well-shaped guess). The observed ledger carries
 * //    no tool RESULTS, so existence/provenance past the bk_/ast_ shape check cannot be decided
 * //    here — conditioned prose only. (N round 1 / N4-T1: getBooking + getAsset read tools were
 * //    ADDED to the surface so the model can verify instead of accept/fabricate; still no gate —
 * //    forcing a read would deny the user-supplied-real-id sibling, the N3-M1 lesson.)
 * //  - PII MINIMIZATION: surface only what the user needs from a customer record, keep contact
 * //    masked as returned, and NEVER disclose one customer's record while acting for another —
 * //    request-dependent wording; no check may read the user's context.
 * //  - POLICY GROUNDING / PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARY: every policy statement grounded in a lookupPolicy
 * //    result, never a rule/number invented, never advice beyond the returned text (not a lawyer) —
 * //    reply-content judgement, language-layer.
 * //  - HOLD↔CLAIM LINK PRECISION: that the hold being released is the one linked to the still-open
 * //    claim. The projection exposes openClaimCount but no hold→claim edge, so the releaseHold
 * //    precondition below approximates it coarsely (any open claim blocks a release); the exact
 * //    linkage is eval-only.
