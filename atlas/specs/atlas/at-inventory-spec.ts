/**
 * at-inventory — the asset-registry / maintenance / retire-transfer agent for the "atlas" subject
 * (Atlas Equipment Rentals & Field Ops). Bucket: Inventory & Catalog (9 tools; 2 destructive).
 *
 * Layer rationale (single AgentSpecBase, P9): the constructor auto-installs the universal invariants
 * (noDuplicateCall + degeneration + emptyReply, + noFalseFailureClaim because this bundle injects
 * cfg.lexicon.falseFailureClaimRe) and, because destructiveTools is non-empty, confirmFirst
 * (arg-flag mechanism — both destructive tools carry a `confirmed` flag) + destructiveThrottle on
 * retireAsset/transferAsset. Everything below is the agent layer, derived ONLY from atlas
 * WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + projection() (never a gold spec).
 *
 * Guard-observable frontier encoded here (decidable → one gate each):
 *   - assetId call-shape ....... argFormat  (^ast_[a-z0-9]+$ — never invent an id)
 *   - target-workspace shape .... argFormat  (^ws_[a-z0-9]+$ on transferAsset)
 *   - fleet permission .......... precondition(run) on every fleet WRITE (projection.canManageFleet)
 *   - legal/compliance hold ..... custom(run) on retire/transfer (projection.frozenAssetIds)
 *   - destructive two-step ...... AUTO (confirmFirst + destructiveThrottle) — NOT hand-added
 *   - destructive claim honesty . destructiveClaimRequiresSuccess + pendingConfirmMustAsk (retire/transfer)
 *   - write-success honesty ..... noFabricatedSuccess on register/update/schedule/complete
 *
 * // UNCHECKABLE (no guard-observable discriminator on the allowed surface — behavior prose + eval only):
 * //  - Never invent or MISREPORT an asset's condition or maintenance history beyond what a read
 * //    returned. Language-layer honesty: no (args, world, observed) predicate separates a truthful
 * //    read-back from an invented fact without reading the user's request. Eval dimension only.
 * //  - retire/transfer is also blocked when the asset is OUT on rental or RESERVED by an active
 * //    booking. projection() exposes frozenAssetIds (checked) but NO per-asset booking key, so this
 * //    half is not decidable here — the world enforces it (ASSET_OUT / ASSET_RESERVED) and the reply
 * //    must relay the blocker honestly. Eval dimension only.
 * //  - Act DIRECTLY on the primary non-destructive action (register / update / schedule) — do not ask
 * //    permission for it. Behavior prose, not a guard.
 * //  - Id PROVENANCE past the ast_ shape (act only on ids a read surfaced OR the user supplied) —
 * //    dropped as a gate in N round 1 (N3-M1: stricter than world+eval; cases hand real ids in the
 * //    user turn). Conditioned prose + eval dimension, matching the claims/admin drafters.
 * //  - Maintenance lifecycle ORDERING (complete-after-schedule) — dropped as a gate in N round 1
 * //    (N2-1/N3-M2: seeded mid-maintenance windows falsify a conversation-scoped requiresBefore).
 * //    The world enforces NOT_IN_MAINTENANCE; conditioned prose carries the rule.
 * //  - scheduleMaintenance on an asset OUT on rental is rejected by the world (ASSET_OUT) — no
 * //    per-asset booking key in projection(); conditioned prose + honest relay. (N4-B2; eval gap
 * //    logged in EVALS.md.)
