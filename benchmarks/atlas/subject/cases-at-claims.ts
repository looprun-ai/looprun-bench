/**
 * ATLAS_CASES_AT_CLAIMS — the eval set for the atlas "Claims & Compliance" agent bucket
 * (at-claims). Twelve boundary-biased scenarios (ids 41–52) exercising the eight standard
 * G3 axes for THIS bucket's tool surface:
 *   listClaims · getClaim · fileClaim · addClaimEvidence · resolveClaim ·
 *   listHolds · placeHold · releaseHold · listCustomers · getCustomer · createCustomer · lookupPolicy
 * (destructive: resolveClaim(approve/settle), releaseHold — two-step confirm).
 *
 * AUTHORING PROVENANCE (agentspec-generator, Stage G3 / BARRED): cases are derived ONLY from
 * WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + presets.ts + world.ts + judge-prompt.md — NEVER from any drafted
 * AgentSpec (a spec-derived eval would test the spec against itself). Each case was validated by
 * rigid-Advocate-vs-two-Judges debate (label faithfulness / satisfiability / unambiguity), refined
 * ≤2× or discarded. The dimension→case map and per-case verdicts live in EVALS-at-claims.md.
 *
 * TYPE NOTE: these are ScenarioSpec-shaped, but this self-contained subject uses its own
 * `brandPreset` names (the presets in presets.ts) and a single `conversationMode: 'ALL'`, neither
 * of which is a member of the Criaty BrandPreset / AGENT_MODES enums the imported ScenarioSpec type
 * pins. The self-contained pack maps these strings at load time (exactly as beauty/cases.ts and
 * config/examples/toy.ts do) — hence the `as unknown as ScenarioSpec[]` cast.
 *
 * DETERMINISM: REFERENCE_DATE = 2026-07-01 (a fixed literal, never the wall clock). Every id below
 * is a fixed function of the preset seed; a fileClaim in an initially claim-free preset mints
 * clm_3001 (reads never advance the id sequence). Seeded ids referenced here:
 *   default/onboarded : bk_1002 (returned, ast_load01, cust_2002, deposit 2500, no invoice) ·
 *                       bk_1001 (confirmed) · bk_1003+inv_7003 (closed/paid) · ast_boom01 (out) ·
 *                       customers cust_2001 Redstone / cust_2002 Vista / cust_2003 Harbor Point.
 *   open-claim        : bk_1001 (returned, ast_load01, cust_2002, deposit 2500) ·
 *                       clm_3001 (damage, UNDER_REVIEW, holdId hold_9001) ·
 *                       hold_9001 (safety/asset/ast_load01, investigatory).
 *   legal-hold-active : bk_1001 (returned, ast_excv01, cust_2003, inv_7001 paid) ·
 *                       hold_9001 (legal/asset/ast_excv01, litigation) ·
 *                       hold_9002 (compliance/account/cust_2003, KYC). NO open claim.
 * Policies (lookupPolicy): deposit_refund · damage_liability · hold_release · cancellation ·
 * late_return (lateMultiplier 0.5) · insurance. lateFee = lateDays × dailyRate × 0.5.
