/**
 * atlas — at-admin AgentSpec (Workspace Admin bucket).
 *
 * Bucket rationale (E1, tool-need): workspace/tenant admin, members & roles, and plan/quota — the 9
 * tools that read or mutate the tenant itself (getWorkspace, getPlanUsage, listMembers, getMember,
 * inviteMember, updateMemberRole, removeMember, changePlan, getAuditLog). Two carry a two-step
 * `confirmed` protocol (removeMember, changePlan) → passed as destructiveTools, so the constructor
 * auto-installs confirmFirst + destructiveThrottle on exactly those.
 *
 * Layer rationale: ONE AgentSpecBase. The constructor owns the always-on invariants (noDuplicateCall,
 * degenerationGuard, emptyReply) and, from destructiveTools, the destructive-safety protocol — never
 * hand-added here. The agent layer adds the decidable frontier this bucket exposes over projection():
 * privilege preconditions (member ops need canManageMembers; changePlan is owner-only), the seat-cap
 * gate on inviteMember, member-id shape, and the reply-honesty guards keyed on attempt/success.
 *
 * UNCHECKABLE (no observable predicate over the guard surface — projection() keys + observed calls;
 * left to conditioned prose + an eval dimension so N4/G3 can still measure the miss):
 *  - Tenant isolation: every op is scoped to the active workspace by the world; no projection key
 *    exposes cross-tenant identity for a check to gate on.
 *  - Member-id provenance: "use mem_ ids that came from listMembers/getMember this conversation, never
 *    invent one" — GuardCtx.observed carries no prior-result ids and projection() lists no member ids,
 *    so provenance-to-a-real-read cannot be decided. (argFormat still enforces the mem_ SHAPE.)
 *  - Sole-owner protection: "cannot remove or demote the last owner / self-demote" — projection()
 *    exposes no owner count nor the target member's role; the world enforces it, the reply reports it.
 *  - Quota/usage anti-fabrication: state seat/booking/quota numbers only from getPlanUsage — an
 *    arbitrary numeric claim is not a decidable predicate over projection().
 *  - Audit grounding: answer "did X happen / when" only from getAuditLog — a free-text history claim
 *    is not decidable from the guard surface.
 *  - Plan DOWNGRADE below current usage is rejected by the world (DOWNGRADE_BELOW_USAGE): the target
 *    plan's caps are world constants not exposed in projection(), so the compare is not decidable
 *    here; conditioned prose carries the rule and the reply must relay the rejection honestly.
 *    (N4-A2, N round 1; eval gap logged in EVALS.md.)
