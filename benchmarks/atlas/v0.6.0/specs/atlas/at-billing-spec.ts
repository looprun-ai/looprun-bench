/**
 * atlas / at-billing — the billing & payments agent (quotes, invoices, deposits, payments/refunds).
 *
 * Bucket-A layering: every behavior line is CONDITIONED ("when X, do Y"); the persona is the config
 * field (rendered as the first Behavior bullet); the destructive money-movers get the auto
 * confirmFirst + destructiveThrottle protocol from `destructiveTools` (never hand-added). The
 * agent-layer guards below encode the decidable frontier of this agent's domain rules; the numeric
 * FIDELITY of quotes/invoices/refund-caps is language-layer (see the UNCHECKABLE header) — the world
 * computes the money and enforces the caps, so a guard can only key on the observable surface.
 *
 * // UNCHECKABLE (eval-dimension only — no observable predicate over args/tool/world/observed/result):
 * //  - Quote/invoice numeric FIDELITY: the reply must state the EXACT total the tool returned
 * //    (dailyRate×billableDays + fees, lateFee math). A check cannot regex an arbitrary correct
 * //    number; enforced by prose + generateQuote/getInvoice grounding + the eval.
 * //  - "generate the invoice before paying/voiding it" as ORDERING: a requiresBefore(generateInvoice)
 * //    gate would false-fire on presets that SEED an issued invoice (pending-confirmation), so the
 * //    lifecycle stays prose; the world owns the transitions (can't pay a void invoice, can't void a
 * //    paid one) and the reply-honesty guards cover the claims.
 * //  - Refund CAP as a number: issueRefund is capped at amountPaid (world-enforced, REFUND_OVER_CAP).
 * //    argRequired('amount') guards presence; the numeric cap itself is world-owned + prose.
 * //  - Deposit-shortfall / "is this deposit covered?" honesty: read from getDepositBalance — a
 * //    language-layer report, not a decidable veto.
 * //  - releaseDeposit blocked by an ASSET-scope hold on the booking's asset: projection() has no
 * //    booking→asset map, so only the accountFrozen + open-claim halves are decidable here; the
 * //    asset-hold half is world-enforced and the reply must relay it. (N4-B3, N round 1.)
