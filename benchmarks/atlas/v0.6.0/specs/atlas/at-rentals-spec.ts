/**
 * at-rentals — Atlas Equipment Rentals & Field Ops, the RENTALS & DISPATCH agent.
 *
 * Bucket: reserve / reschedule / cancel rentals; check assets out and in; close settled bookings;
 * dispatch and cancel field-technician jobs. Derived from atlas/WORLD-MODEL.md + tools.json + the
 * projection() in world.ts (the ONLY keys a check may read). No gold spec was consulted — every rule
 * is engineered from this domain's own docs/schemas, in the format of references/spec-template.ts.
 *
 * Layer rationale: ONE AgentSpecBase. The constructor auto-installs the universal invariants
 * (noDuplicateCall, degenerationGuard, emptyReply), noFalseFailureClaim (because the lexicon supplies
 * falseFailureClaimRe), and — because cancelBooking/cancelDispatch are in destructiveTools — the
 * destructive-safety protocol (confirmFirst + destructiveThrottle) on those two. Everything below is
 * the agent layer: the decidable frontier of THIS bucket, one gate per rule on its natural hook.
 *
 * // UNCHECKABLE (no observable projection key — conditioned prose + eval dimension only, so N4/G3 see them):
 * //   - Check-in precedes close: closeBooking needs the booking's own status='returned' (plus paid
 * //     invoice, released deposit, no open claim) — per-booking lifecycle is NOT in projection() (only
 * //     aggregate counts), and the default preset seeds an already-returned booking the agent never
 * //     checked in, so a requiresBefore(['checkInAsset']) gate would wrongly block it. World-enforced.
 * //   - Dispatch requires an ACTIVE booking (confirmed/out, not cancelled/closed): per-booking status
 * //     is not a projection key — world-enforced (BOOKING_NOT_DISPATCHABLE); prose only.
 * //   - Check-out blocked on a frozen asset/account or a deposit shortfall for a SPECIFIC booking:
 * //     checkOutAsset args carry only bookingId; projection() has no booking→asset / booking→deposit
 * //     map (only aggregate frozenAssetIds / depositShortfall), so the specific booking can't be keyed.
 * //   - Scope boundary — deposit charge/release, invoicing, payments, refunds are the Billing agent's
 * //     job: none of those tools are on this surface, so there is nothing to gate; prose forbids the claim.
